            <p>You dont really need a whole lot of equipment to jump into birdwatching. Myabe grab a trusty rusty pair of binoculars. If you're feeling real spicy you could grab a camera too.</p>

            <p>Lets be honest though, if you've not done it you probably aren't going to. Realistically it sounds really boring but this was the template for this assignment. Play baseball, dont birdwatch.</p>
